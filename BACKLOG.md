# Backlog

- **Calendar UI tile** — `/api/calendar` exists and is wired in
  `api.ts`/`types.ts`; no UI surface yet.
- **Postgres persistence layer** — trade journal, server-side watchlists,
  analytics history. Replaces direct-Alpaca-only reads + `localStorage`
  prefs. Free tier (Supabase/Neon).
- **Write-auth gate (Charter Hard Rule #3)** — `require_write_auth` in
  `backend/app/main.py` is an intentional no-op seam; flip it to a
  shared-token check before any non-paper / non-private exposure.
  Deferred by decision (paper account).
